Make a comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC by answering:
What type of infrastructure and application deployments are each tool best suited for?
1. Serverless Framework: AWS Lambda, API Gateway
2. Terraform: servers, networking, databases, and serverless.

How do their primary objectives differ?
1. Serverless Framework: Focuses on simplifying the deployment of serverless applications.
2. Terraform: Provides a comprehensive IaC tool to provision and manage any type of infrastructure.

How do they differ in terms of learning curve and ease of use for developers or DevOps teams?
1. Serverless Framework: Easier to learn for serverless-specific deployments with simple configuration files.
2. Terraform: More complex syntax.

What are the differences in how each tool handles state tracking and deployment changes?
1. Serverless Framework: Tracks deployment state internally but doesnâ€™t provide granular control over infrastructure state.
2. Terraform: Uses a state file to track infrastructure changes, offering precise management of resources.

In what scenarios would you recommend using Serverless Framework over Terraform, and vice versa?
1. Serverless Framework: For teams focusing on serverless applications and needing quick deployment with minimal setup.
2. Terraform: For managing complex, multi-cloud, or hybrid infrastructure.


Are there scenarios where using both together might be beneficial?
When: 
1. Terraform provisions the underlying infrastructure (e.g., VPC, databases).
2. Serverless Framework deploys serverless applications on top of it.
